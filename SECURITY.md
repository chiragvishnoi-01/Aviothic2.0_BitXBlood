# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

We take the security of the BloodLink platform seriously. Here are the measures we've implemented to protect the project:

### Environment Variables Protection
- All sensitive environment variables are stored in `.env` files
- `.env` files are added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- Example environment files (`.env.example`) are provided for reference
- Never commit actual credentials or secrets to the repository

### Data Protection
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salting
- JWT tokens are used for authentication with secure expiration
- All API endpoints are protected with appropriate middleware
- CORS is properly configured to prevent unauthorized access

### Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities
- Secure database connections with proper authentication
- Role-based access control for different user types

## üîê Environment Variables

The application requires several environment variables to function properly. These should be stored in a `.env` file in the respective directories:

### Backend Environment Variables
```env
# MongoDB Connection URI (required)
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret Key (required)
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret

# Email Configuration (optional)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password

# Port (optional, defaults to 5001)
PORT=5001

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Allowed Origins for CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://your-deployment-url.com
```

### Frontend Environment Variables
```env
# API URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```
