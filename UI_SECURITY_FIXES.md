## 🔒 Security Improvements

### **What Was Fixed:**
- ❌ **Removed:** Public admin credentials from Login page
- ✅ **Result:** More secure, professional appearance
- ✅ **Best Practice:** Credentials should never be public

### **Recommendation:**
After deployment, create admin account manually:

**Option 1: Via Database (MongoDB Compass)**
```javascript
{
  name: "Admin",
  email: "your-secure-email@domain.com",
  password: "your-secure-password", // Use strong password
  role: "admin",
  isDonor: false
}
```

**Option 2: Via Backend Route (Create once, then disable)**
```javascript
// Add temporary route in authRoutes.js
router.post('/create-admin', async (req, res) => {
  const admin = new User({
    name: "Admin",
    email: "admin@yourdomain.com",
    password: "SecurePassword123!",
    role: "admin"
  });
  await admin.save();
  res.json({ message: "Admin created" });
});
```
